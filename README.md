## Lumi Pampers Website

This repository contains the code for the Lumi Pampers website. The live site is hosted on [https://lumipampers.netlify.app/](https://lumipampers.netlify.app/).

### Background

The final design of the website was based on image files rather than the Figma designs. This decision was made because there were discrepancies between the two, but all the assets required for the image designs were available. Therefore, it was decided to use the available assets from the image designs instead.
